The initialization is divided in two steps:

- First step consists in a NVT simulation during 100 ps using the Berendsen thermostat to gradually heat the system to
 298.15 K;
- The second step is a NPT ensemble (100 ps) with a Parrinello-Rahman barostat to couple the pressure (1 atm) 
two initialization steps were performed and three replicates were obtained.
 
r1 corresponds to replicate number one. Different replicates can be obtained since a random seed is used to generate the inital velocities 
(gen_seed            =  -1)
