In this step, a production run of 10 ns is performed using the same conditions as in the last step of initialization/equilibration. 

For all steps, the van der Waals interactions were truncated at 1.0 nm, whereas for the electrostatic interactions, a 1.0 nm cutoff for direct contributions was used. 

Long-range electrostatic interactions were treated with the fast smooth particle-mesh Ewald (PME) method.

**BE CAREFUL**: in the slurm_MD.dat file you should change the following variables:
- sys=XXX (here: 1J91)
- lig=YYY (here: TBS)
- rep=ZZZ (1)
