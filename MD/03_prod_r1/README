In this step, a production run of 10 ns is performed using the same conditions as in the last step of initialization/equilibration. 

For all steps, the van der Waals interactions were truncated at 1.0 nm, whereas for the electrostatic interactions, a 1.0 nm cutoff for direct contributions was used. 

Long-range electrostatic interactions were treated with the fast smooth particle-mesh Ewald (PME) method.

You need to run slurm_MD.sh to run the simulations. It uses the slurm_MD.dat and generic_input.mdp file (each has the parameters required for the simulation)

**BE CAREFUL**: in the slurm_MD.dat file you should change the following variables:
- sys=XXX (here: 1J91)
- lig=YYY (here: TBS)
- rep=ZZZ (here: 1)
